Problem   Sheet   1   (revision) 1.          A   bar   of   intrinsic   germanium   at   300   K   has   2.5   x   1019    electrons   per   cubic   metre   in   the   conduction   band.   Find   the   net   current   density   when   an   electric   field   of   500Vm-1    is   applied   to   the   bar.   Assume μh       =       0.   19m2      v −1s −1 and μe      =      0.39m2   v−1s −1 .
2.          The   resistivity   of   intrinsic   silicon   at   27℃   is   3000Ω m.   Assuming      μe          =      0.   17m2   v−1s −1 and μh          =   0.035m2   v−1s −1 , calculate   the   intrinsic   carrier   density   ni      at   this   temperature.
3.          A   current   density   of   103   A   m-2    flows   through   an   n-type   germanium   crystal   of   resistivity   0.05Ω   m.   Calculate   the   time   taken   for   electrons   to   travel   5   ×   10-5   m, if   the   mobility   is      μe          = 0.39m2   v−1s −1 .4.          Compare   the   drift   velocity   of   an   electron   moving   in   a   field   of   10000V   m-1    in   pure   germanium, with   the    final velocity of   an electron that has moved through a distance l0mm   in   the   same   field   in   a   vacuum.

5.          A   rod   of   p-type   germanium   6mm   long,   1mm   wide   and   0.5mm   thick   has   an   electrical   resistance   of   l20Ω   .   What is the impurity concentration? What proportion of   the conductivity is due   to   electrons   in   the conduction   band? (Take      μh       =      0.   19m2   v−1s   −1   ,    μe      =      0.39m2   v−1s   −1   , and   ni   = 2.5   ×   1019   m-3.)
6.          Calculate the   faction   of   electrons in   the   conduction band   at room temperature   for   (a) pure   Germanium   (Eg   = 0.72eV), (b) pure   Silicon   (Eg   =   1.10eV) and   (c) pure   diamond   (Eg   =   5.6eV),   and   comment   on   the   results.
7.          Pure   silicon   has   resistivity   2000Ω   m   at   room   temperature,   and   the   density   of   conduction   electrons   is   1.4   ×   1016m-3. Calculate   the   resistivities   of   two   other, doped, samples   containing   acceptor   concentrations   of   1021m-3            and   1023m-3   respectively. Assume   that   the   hole   mobility   remains   the   same   as   in   pure   silicon   and   that   it   is   equal    to   0.26 times   the   electron   mobility.
